What's the most fundamental component of the technical interview? **Data structures and Algorithms (DSA).** Building a strong fundamental understanding before tackling Leetcode style questions will 1) make you a better programmer with stronger fundamental knowledge of the field, but more importantly 2) build a tool box of approaches you can use to reason and solve any technical question you may face. 

The language you use for these problems should be job-specific. Most people just use python for syntactic simplicity, but if you're applying to be a C++ dev it would be weird to not use C++ during the interview. In my case, I'm interesting in C/C++, so the content below follows suite.

## Table of Contents

- [Data Structures](#data-structures)
- [Algorithms](#algorithms)

## Data Structures

- [Vector](/data-structures/vector/)
- [Linked List](/data-structures/linked_list/)
- Stack
- Queue
- Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.)
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graphs (Directed, Undirected, Weighted)
- Trie (pronounced "tree")
- Linked Hash Map

Run the following commands to build and run the unit tests:

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cd build && ctest
```

## Algorithms

- Sorting algorithms (Comparison and non-comparison sorting)
- Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
- Traversals (Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS)
- Prefix-tree searches
