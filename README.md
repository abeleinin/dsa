What's the most fundamental component of the technical interview? **Data structures and Algorithms (DSA).** Building a strong fundamental understanding before tackling Leetcode style questions will 1) make you a better programmer with stronger fundamental knowledge of the field, but more importantly 2) build a tool box of approaches you can use to reason and solve any technical question you may face.
