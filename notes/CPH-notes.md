Introduction

### Mathematics
Important knowledge to knew/review when solving programming problems.

#### Sum Formulas

$\sum^n_{x = 1} x^k = 1^k + 2^k + 3^k + ... + n^k$

Arithmetic progressions

Geometric progressions

Harmonic sum

#### Set Theory

##### Intersection: 
Items in both A and B.
$$
A = \{1, 2, 5\} \\
B = \{2, 4\} \\
A \cap B = \{2\}
$$

##### Union: 
Items in A and B or both.
$$
A = \{3, 7\} \\
B = \{2, 3, 8\} \\
A \cup B = \{2, 3, 4, 8\}
$$

##### Complement: 
Elements that are not in A.
$$  
U = \{1, ... , 10\} \\
A = \{1, 2, 3, 7\} \\
\overline{A} = \{4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10\} 
$$

##### Difference: 
Elements that are in A but not in B.
$$
A = \{2, 3, 7, 8\} \\
B = \{2, 5, 8\} \\
A \backslash D = A \cap \overline{B} = \{2, 7\}
$$

##### Subset: 
If each element of A belongs to S, we say that A is a subset of S. Denoted $A \subset S$.
